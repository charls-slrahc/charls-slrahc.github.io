            The history of Stanford, from its inception in the late 1800s until now, has been shaped
            by the American West’s mindset of openness and possibility. Creating and sharing knowledge, 
            and encouraging students to think and behave with curiosity and critical judgment stands central
            to our belief in higher education. Offering exceptional academic standards, Stanford brings together
            seven schools and prominent scholars all located in one place. By mixing education with research, it 
            helps spread new ideas and findings to the world outside the lab and classroom.We highly encourage 
            Stanford students to think, discuss, and question, as we help them grow into people who give a lot to 
            the wider world.

            <h2>Excellence</h2>
            <p>
                Stanford gives students a chance to think about big topics, work on ideas from different fields, and learn to respect different ways of thinking and experiences. We offer many different study programs to choose from, like programs in the arts and humanities, natural and social sciences, engineering, sustainability, medicine, law, education, and business. The university’s strong research and spirit of innovation help bring in world-class teachers, who give students the information and skills they need to learn and find new ideas, and to get ready for their future careers and lives. The need for good ethical rules is built into what we teach and also how we prepare our students for doing their best for society (stanford.edu).

            <h2>Encouragement</h2>
            <p>
                Innovation and understanding happen when we exchange and share different concepts. We encourage open dialogue, pay close attention to what is said, and protect the freedom of all members of the university community to learn. It gives people the right to study and explore topics freely. Having the right to question any beliefs, whatever their age, and to say and think what you like. The EPluribus Stanford program encourages students to think deeply, care about others, participate in lively talks that bridge gaps, and engage in civic actions for the rest of their lives in any professional area. Stanford holds that finding solutions to the problems in the world involves individuals with different backgrounds and fields of expertise engaging in dialogue, even when they differ. The goal is supported by EPluribus through advancing and increasing work on free speech, civics, democratic citizenship, and effective dialogue (stanford.edu).

            <h2>Researches Fueled by innovation</h2>
            <p>
                An important aspect of Stanford is the wide range of important research conducted between various subjects. The proximity of all seven of our schools and the presence of many centers for research on campus lead to many breakthroughs. Stanford’s newest school, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, combines knowledge from many fields to solve problems related to Earth, climate, and society. The scholars at Stanford are praised for their achievements in various academic areas. Besides the 36 Nobel Prize winners since Stanford was established, and tying with others for the most Nobel wins in the past twenty years, Stanford is also where numerous recipients of Pulitzer Prizes, National Medals, and MacArthur Fellows are found. Efforts made at Stanford add to our knowledge and give rise to advances that strengthen the U.S. role in the world (stanford.edu).

            <h2>Financial Support</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to make sure that financial aid opens up opportunities for all admitted students here. The majority, or about three out of four, Stanford undergraduates are offered some form of financial assistance. Domestic students with a family income of less than $150,000 do not have to pay tuition. Over 80 percent of Stanford students finish their degrees without having to take on debt (stanford.edu).

            <h2>A thriving Student</h2>
            <p>
                The residential aspect of Stanford’s campus is a vital element of its first-rate education. People come from all over the world to study at Stanford, ranging from acapella singers to Olympic athletes. At the university, students get to join from a huge variety of organizations, from religious, ethnic, and cultural ones to arts and community service-related, and those for social, athletic, and recreational activities. In addition, Stanford has 36 varsity teams – 20 for women and 16 for men – plus physical education classes on campus, fitness and wellness, aquatics, intramurals, different adventure programs, and 43 club sports (stanford.edu).

            <h2>Building Strong Relationships</h2>
            <p>
                Stanford is proud to be a citizen of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. We engage and build meaningful relationships with our neighbors through events, public exhibitions and performances in the arts, lectures, and lifelong learning, both on campus and online. Stanford has a strong commitment to the arts, and we invite our community to visit our two world-class museums, multiple performance venues, and the historic buildings and open spaces of our campus. We support local parents with access to health information, help K-12 teachers increase interest and involvement in math and science, and provide the local business community with access to lectures by today’s entrepreneurial thought leaders (stanford.edu).
