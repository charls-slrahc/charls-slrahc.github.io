            From its founding in California in the late 19th century until today, 
            Stanford has been infused with the American West’s spirit of openness and possibility. 
            We believe strongly in the mission of higher education – 
            to create and share knowledge and to prepare students to be curious, to think critically, 
            and to contribute to the world. With world-class scholars and seven schools located together on a single campus, 
            Stanford offers academic excellence across the broadest array of disciplines. It also is an engine of innovation, 
            blending theory and practice to move ideas and discoveries from labs and classrooms out into the world. 
            We strive to foster a culture of expansive inquiry, fresh thinking, searching discussion, and freedom of thought – 
            preparing students for leadership and engaged citizenship in the world.

        Stanford provides students the opportunity to engage with big ideas, to cross
        conceptual and disciplinary boundaries, and to become global citizens who embrace
        diversity of thought and experience. We offer broad and deep academic programs across
        multiple fields, including the arts and humanities, natural and social sciences,
        engineering, sustainability, medicine, law, education, and business. The university’s
        scholarly excellence and culture of innovation uniquely position it to attract the
        best faculty in the world, who offer students the knowledge and tools to discover
        and embrace new ideas, and to prepare for successful careers and lives of service.
        The need for strong ethical principles to achieve a common good is embedded across
        our educational offerings.
